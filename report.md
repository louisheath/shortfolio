## HTML

A

TODO

I've written a lot of HTML.

HTML is validated.

## CSS

A

Implemented multiple CSS files which together produce a consistent design and theme across all pages of the website.

I have made separate CSS files for some page-specfic styling, however due to the consitency in the theme I have been able to reuse the majority of the sames styles for each page, resulting in clean an modular class names.

## JS

## PNG

I used GIMP to create original artwork, depicting my dog in Cornwall in the middle of a sci-fi war between Godzilla and the Millennium Falcon. 

This involved working with multiple layers and removing backgrounds, as well as using tools such as smudge, crop etc.

The end product can be seen at localhost:8080/u/demo.

## SVG

A

Using Inkscape I was able to create custom icons for the Github and Linkedin links users can optionally add to their website. I was able to import png versions of the original logos, and use `Path > Trace Bitmap` to convert them into paths. Using the boolean Path functions I was able to create round icons by removing shapes from a circle.
